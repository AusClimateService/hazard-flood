# ACS Hazard Team on Riverine Floods 
## Description
GitHub repository for ACS Hazard Team on Riverine Floods to store, track and develop code, data (timeseries, plots and maps).
Changes in the risk of riverine flooding are often associated with changes in the frequency or magnitude of extreme runoff. While extreme runoff does not directly translate to floods, this metric, in conjunction with information about land surface antecedent conditions and hydrological modelling, aid in the assessment of high-flow events that arise from exceptionally wet conditions.

Runoff data from National Hydrogical Projections (NHP) are used to calculate the flood indices for different Global Warming Levels (1,2, 1.5, 2, 3). The NHP comprise an ensemble of bias-corrected climate model data and derived hydrological projections (including runoff projections) at daily temporal and 0.05° × 0.05° spatial resolution for the period 1960–2099 and two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5).

## Indices considered by the hazard team:
- Median annual maximum 1-day runoff
- Annual total runoff – 90th percentile

## Products:
Status of the NCRA deliverables. 

The  dots represent the datasets used to compute indices:

In terms of the colors:
- :green_circle: The data is available in its final official form
- :yellow_circle: The data creation is currently in progress and available soon
- :red_circle: The data processing has not yet started
- :white_circle: Not intended for delivery/not applicable
